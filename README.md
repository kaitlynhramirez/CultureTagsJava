Requirements.

The game should confirm the userâ€™s input has been added and show the last 3 cards that have been added to the system

Considerations What did you do to make sure that the answers that users enter match what is saved on the card? (i.e. typos, case sensitivity, etc.) How is the card data being stored? What data structure is used? Why was that ADT chosen compared to other ADTs? Assume that the number of cards can be a very large number.
